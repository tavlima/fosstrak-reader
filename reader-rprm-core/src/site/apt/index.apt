Reader Module


* Features  
   
   *  implements the EPCglobal Reader Protocol Version 1.1. in Java. Elements of the protocol implemented include:
    
    	*   Transport Binding: TCP and HTTP
 
    	*   Message Binding: XML and Text
    	
    	*   Synchronous and Asynchronous Messaging (Notification Channels)
    	
    	*   Triggers
    	
    	*   Data Selectors
    	
    A detailed list of the features implemented is available here.

   *  supports readers from the following manufacturers as a surrogate (or in reader protocol terms as a concentrator).

	*   Feig
	
	*   Hitachi
	
	*   Softronica
	
   *  provides graphical RFID reader simulator and an extensive simulation framework.
    

* Usage Scenarios

   *   Enable one-of-the-above readers that do not implement the EPCglobal Reader Protocol yet by deploying the software on a surrogate 
   
   *   Write your own wrapper for your reader and then leverage the filtering, event generation and messaging provided by our reader implementation
           
   *   Simulate a single reader via a graphical user interface 
   
   *   Simulate a network of hundred of readers using the simulation framework
       
   *   Embed our reader implementation in your reader

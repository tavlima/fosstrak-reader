Changes in version 0.3.1 (4 June 2007)

- the command readerDevice.removeTriggers is working now (previously the GUI listed the command as readerDevice.removeTrigger)

- the command readerDevice.getNotificationChannels is working now (previously the GUI listed the command as readerDevice.getNotificationChannel)

- The XML binding did not work due to a backwards compatibility problem of JDK1.6 and JDK1.5, when the software was run with JDK1.5. This has been fixed in the current release.

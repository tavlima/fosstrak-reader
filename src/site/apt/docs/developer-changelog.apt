** {HardwareAbstraction} Interface

  Changed <<<HardwareAbstraction>>> interface to remove inconsistencies and add
  new features. Most methods are affected. The changes can be divided into
  following categories:

  * The <<<Observation>>> returned by the <<<identify>>> method can contain a
    <<<TagDescriptor>>> for each tag observed with information about the tag
    type and memory layout.

  * The data of the <<<readBytes>>> and <<<writeBytes>>> methods is stored in a
    <<<UnsignedByteArray>>> instead of a (signed) <<<byte\[\]>>>.

  * Error reporting has been improved with adding additional declarations for
    exceptions that can arise in the method implementation. Most notably parameter
    check can return a specific <<<ReadPointNotFoundException>>> or
    <<<OutOfBoundsException>>> if it fails.

  * A (mandantory) <<<getReadPointNames>>> method has been added.

  * Every method that is not required to be implemented provides an additional
    'supports'-method. If an optional method is implemented, the associated
    'supports'-method returns true. If an optional method is not implemented and
    returns an <<<UnsupportedOperationException>>>, the associated
    'supports'-method returns false.

  * The <<<kill>>> method takes a <<<readPointName>>> argument to be consistent
    with <<<readBytes>>> and <<<writeBytes>>> methods.

  * Some methods have been renamed. The method <<<programId>>> is now called
    <<<writeId>>>. Furthermore <<<getAntennaPowerLevel>>> and
    <<<getAntennaNoiseLevel>>> have been renamed to <<<getReadPointPowerLevel>>>
    and <<<getReadPointNoiseLevel>>> respectively to be consistent with the
    <<<startUpReadPoint>>>, <<<shutDownReadPoint>>> and <<<isReadPointReady>>>
    methods.

  * The methods for asynchronous identify have been changed to allow multiple
    listeners. Starting and stopping does not require a listener. These are added
    and removed with separat methods independent of start and stop.


** {Own} Project

  The HAL has moved from a module of Accada Reader to an own project. It is
  subdivided into a module containing the <<<HardwareAbstraction>>> interface
  with common utilities and modules with implementations of the interface.
  Each implementation module contains one or more reader controller of a reader
  manufacturer or the simulator.


** {Impinj} SPeedway

  A <<<HardwareAbstraction>>> implementation for the Impinj Speedway reader has
  been added. The controller implements nearly all methods of the interface:
  <<<identify>>> (mandantory), <<<readBytes>>>, <<<writeBytes>>>, <<<writeId>>>,
  <<<reset>>>, <<<kill>>>, asynchronous identify and parameters. Not supported
  is shutting down and starting up a read point and getting read point noise
  level. Some parameters of the reader can be read and set using the
  <<<getParameter>>> and <<<setParameter>>> methods:

  * <<<ReaderInfo>>> (read only)

  * <<<TxPower>>>

  * <<<SupportedGen2Params>>> (read only)

  * <<<Gen2Params>>>

  * <<<LBTParams>>>

  * <<<RxConfig>>>

  See Impinj Mach1 protocol specification for information about functionality
  and format of the parameters.


** FEIG {MR}101-A

  A <<<HardwareAbstraction>>> implementation for FEIG OBID i-scan ID ISC.MR101-A
  has been added. The controller implements <<<identify>>> (mandantory),
  <<<readBytes>>>, <<<writeBytes>>>, <<<reset>>> and <<<kill>>> commands.

  The implementation supports the FEIG OBID i-scan ID ISC.ANT.MUX multiplexer with
  8 ports. Multiplexers can be cascaded to a depth of three. This allows a maximum
  of 512 antennas on a single reader.


** FEIG {LRU}1000

  A <<<HardwareAbstraction>>> implementation for FEIG OBID i-scan ID ISC.LRU1000
  has been added. The controller implements <<<identify>>> (mandantory),
  <<<readBytes>>>, <<<writeBytes>>>, <<<reset>>> and <<<kill>>> commands.


** {XML} Configuration Files

  All configuration files have been changed to XML format instead of a mix of
  XML and properties. This increases consistency and XML allows a hierarchical
  structures which is more readable for complex configurations.


** {Resource} Loading

  Resource loading has been completely redesigned. This fixes {{{http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1547832&group_id=170795&atid=855583}1547832}}.

  There were several issues with the previous implementation of resource loading:

  * Resource loading was not done uniformly. Sometimes <<<FileInputStream>>> was
    used, elsewere <<<Class.getResourceAsStream>>> or <<<Class.getResource>>>.
    Each of these works at bit different, looks for the file at its own places
    and needs more or less path adjustments to load a file that is packaged in
    a Java archive.

  * A path and postfix of the file name was hardcoded sometimes which made it
    difficult to name the file correctly and extract the corresponding prefix.

  * To adjust a configuration file to its own needs, the Java archive had to be
    extracted and started in a console by hand instead of just clicking on the
    executable jar file.

  The new implementation fixes these issues in the following way:

  * Locating the resource files is done in a dedicated helper class for all
    resources.

  * The location search algorithm is sophisticated and works for relativ paths
    with or without leading slash, files in or outsite Java archives, path
    relative to various places or absolute and the possibility to give a default
    file name in case a custom file can not be found.

  * The resource locator first searches for the custom file. If no custom file
    can be found, the algorithm takes the default file. It is not necessary to
    extract the Java archive to customize resources such as configuration files.


** {Simulated} Tag Memory

  Changed the tag memory layout of the simulated tag to match the EPCclass1Gen2
  standard. The simulated tag now has 64 bit reserved memory, 256 bit EPC memory
  including CRC and PC bits, 64 bit TID memory with random 32 bit serial number
  and 256 bit of user memory.


** {EPCclass1Gen2} Tag Models

  An <<<EPCTransponderModel>>> class has been added to represent many different
  EPCclass1Gen2 tags in software. It provides memory layout information for
  following tag chips:

  * Impinj Monza

  * Impinj Monaco

  * STMicroelectronics XRAG2

  * TexasInstruments Gen2

  * NXP UCODE EPC G2

  * NXP UCODE G2XM

  * NXP UCODE G2XL

  * Alien H2

  * and the Accada Simulator tag with EPCclass1Gen2 compliant memory layout

  These are the most common tag chips also used in tags from other manufacturers.
  New tag chips can simply be added by writing their TID and memory information
  to a configuration file. Thereafter they are fully accessible by all reader
  controllers using the <<<EPCTransponderModel>>>.


** {Graphic} Simulator Memory Access

  The user interface of the graphic simulator has been extended with the
  possibility to read and write the memory banks of a simulated tag.

[../images/memory_banks.png] memory banks in the graphic simulator

  The memory banks can be easily accessed through the context menu of a
  simulated tag.

** {Tag} Descriptor

  With the changed <<<HardwareAbstraction>>> interface, the <<<Observation>>>
  returned by the <<<identify>>> method can contain a <<<TagDescriptor>>> for
  each tag observed. It contains information about the ID type and memory layout
  of the tag. All current implementations (Impinj and FEIG readers) including
  the simulator add a <<<TagDescriptor>>> with accordant information to the
  <<<Observation>>>.

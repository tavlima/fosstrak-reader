Welcome to the Accada Reader Project


* Objective

  The objective of the Reader Project is to implement the reader role in the
  EPC Network and to develop the appropriate tools that facilitate
  communication with the reader instance.


* Organization

[images/ReaderProjectOverview.jpg]

  The Reader Project currently comprises of three separate modules:

  * the Reader RP/RM Core that implements the EPCglobal Reader Protocol and
    Reader Management Specification

  * the Reader RP Proxy that can be used on a host computer to access a Reader
    Protocol compliant reader through a Java interface

  * the Reader RP Client to access a Reader Protocol compliant reader directly
    through a graphical user interface


* Usage Scenarios

  Possible usage scenarios include the following:

  * Enable a reader that does not implement the EPCglobal Reader Protocol or
    the Reader Management Standard by deploying a HAL wrapper - use the Accada
    Reader and HAL as an adaptor.

  * Simulate the deployment of hundreds of readers - use the Accada Reader with
    the simulation framework of the Accada HAL.

  * Test your RFID application without any reader hardware attached - use the
    Accada Reader RP/RM Core with a simulator of the Accada HAL.

  * Interact with a reader that implements the EPCglobal Reader Protocol
    Version 1.1 - use the Accada Reader Client.

  * Communicate with a reader via the EPCglobal Reader Protocol Version 1.1
    from within your Java application - use the Accada Reader RP Proxy.

  * Embed our reader implementation in your reader - this requires a powerful
    reader platform.

Fosstrak Reader Proxy
===================

The objective of the Fosstrak Reader Proxy Module is to provide a Java library to
communicate with a reader via the EPCglobal Reader Protocol Version 1.1 from 
within your Java application. The Java classes in the proxy library encapsulate
the RP specific messaging by providing methods and data structures for the RP.


How to use the Reader Proxy
===========================

- Include as a dependency in your Java project.

- Use the appropriate Java classes and methods to configure the reader device
(or the reader simulator) and execute commands. The proxy also offers reader
configuration via an XML file.
